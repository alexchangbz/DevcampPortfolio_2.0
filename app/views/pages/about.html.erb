<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr>
<p>With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation
process between client and developers are flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to the clients throughout
the development stage, resulting in a final product that falls to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user</p>

<p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused 
communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on project not only do I work to craft the application
according to the client's specification, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly 
with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
